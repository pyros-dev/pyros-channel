The aim of this channel is to hold pyros packages definitions for guix, and solving in that way the burden of python packaging & deployment.

Side Note : Python wheels would be another way to do that (but I see it as more unlikely that someone will pick up that job for ROS and maintain it)

Nonetheless, Pyros packages should be pure python packages, at least for the big majority of them, and the guix definition should strive to be as simple as possible, embedding a python project in guix...
